# Testing Basics

The purpose of this repository is for me to explore and practice the basics of testing JavaScript code. Some of these techniques I have used before, while others are entirely new to me.

## Goals

Here is a list of features that I aim to implement:

- Vue 3 using composition API
- Typescript
- Linting
- use [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- [do not test implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details)
- measure code coverage
- practice mocking
- mock network requests using [msv](https://mswjs.io/)
- take snapshots
- e2e tests on running website using [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) or [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
- automize everything using github actions
- accessible
